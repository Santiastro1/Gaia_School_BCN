This repository is meant to help COST-WG1 MWG School 2020 (MWG_BCN20) participants to set up a work environment for the hands-on sessions of the workshop, as well as donwload some example datasets to be used during these sessions. 

It is assumed that there exists a **working [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installation** on the target machine.

Clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Santiastro1/Gaia_School_BCN.git

```
Create a new environment:

```console
$ conda env create -f Gaia_School_BCN_env.yml
```
Activate the new environment:

```console
$ conda activate MWG_BCN20
```
Verify that the new environment was correctly installed:

```console

```
The name of the new environment, ```MWG_BCN20```, should show up in the list.
